# Driving Swarm
All things driving swarm with global issue tracker and goals (and rather comprehensive **wiki**)

## Goals
- Research swarm-robotic behaviour with robots capable of mapping and planning
- Swarm Applications
  - Foraging
  - Collective Search
  - Dispersion/Formation
- Robotic Topics
  - World Representation in the Context of Swarm Robotics
  - Planning agents within swarms (Cooperative planning, emergent effects in plans and plan execution)
  - Localisation in Robotic Swarms
- Swarm Topics
  - Integration of long term behaviour and short term planning
  - Integration of SI algorithms in robotics applications
  - Swarms with diversity in behaviour
 
## Milestones

- Basic Architecture (wip)
  - [x] Multi-Master ROS
  - [x] ROS-Node controlling the behaviour (BehaviourAPI)
  - [x] Nav-Stack for robot navigation
  - [ ] Basic behaviour with random movement and collision avoidance
  - [x] Central point of control for the swarm (starting and stopping the robots, task distribution)
  - [ ] Optional Goal- Integrate Localisation
  
- Simulation (currently working with Gazebo, slow for many robots)
  - [x] Multiple robots in the same environment
  - [x] Possibly not with multi-master ros but different prefixes per robot conrtoller
  - [x] Same codebase as the real robots
   
- Unified World Representation
  - Have one world reresentation that works for the swarm
  - Semantic Maps, Local Dynamic Maps, ...
  - Needs to include - actions are based on representation not on physical sensors, distinguishes between static environment, dynamic environment and other robots/actors
  - Stretch-Goal - representation contains virtual objects (i.e. pheromones, semantic information)
  - Gossiping protocols for spacial information
  
- Collective Path Planning
  - Solve movement conflicts by collectively agreeing on a trajectory for each robot in a neighbourhood
  - Different Strategies for solving conflicts based on neighbourhood size and interconnectedness of the swarm
  - See how different planners can deal with one scenario
  
- Localisation
  - Multilateration
  - Camera Tracking
  - Sensor fusion
  - AMCL with MAP (localisation part of SLAM)
  
- Full 30 robot swarm
  - Buy and assemble another 27 robots
  - currently 3 (plus 10) 
  
- Implement Collective Behaviour
  - Formation Behaviours
  - Foraging (Indian Cross)
  - Collective Search (e.g. Minimize Distance to Cable Car)

## Repository Structure

- gitman should now be used to check out submodules (cf. wiki)
